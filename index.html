               <p>My plane arrived in the internation airport in Tokyo. When we arrived, we were greeted by relatives and shown around town. Most notably the Kaminarimon market, and Ginza Square. They were night and day from each other as markets. One old and traditional, and the other showing full wonder of 21st century technology.</p>

               <h2>Shinkansen!</h2>
               <img src ="images/Shinkansen.jpg" alt="Shinkansen parked at a station in Tokyo">
               <p>Japan's famous bullet train that goes at least 200kph and can cruise at 355kph. I say cruise because despite it going 220mph. Itll be the smoothest train you'll ever ride. Not to mention the cabin seating is better than any first class seating on a plane. The Shinkansen is a staple and an amazing way to travel to and from all the cities in Japan as I have.</p>
