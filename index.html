               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My plane arrived in the internation airport in Tokyo. When we arrived, we were greeted by relatives and shown around town. Most notably the Kaminarimon market, and Ginza Square. They were night and day from each other as markets. One old and traditional, and the other showing full wonder of 21st century technology.</p>

               <p>Japan's famous bullet train that goes at least 200kph and can cruise at 355kph. I say cruise because despite it going 220mph. Itll be the smoothest train you'll ever ride. Not to mention the cabin seating is better than any first class seating on a plane. The Shinkansen is a staple and an amazing way to travel to and from all the cities in Japan as I have.</p>

               <h2>Kyoto/Osaka</h2>
               <figure>

               <p>One of the first places we toured was the Osaka Castle, in Osaka. It's mostly intact with moats, walls, and gates. Its in amazing condition and the only things changed was for tourism. The infamous gift shops and museum in the actual main castle. It was really breath taking to tour around the insides and feel the history.</p>

               <p>In Kyoto, it looks to be an old religious town that draws in the most tourism in Japan. Over 2000 traditional temples take up Kyoto, and a large amount of markets. The biggest market I visited was the Nishiki shopping district. You could wander around for days. It is huge. Most of our time here was shopping and visiting relatives. </p>

                  <p>Unfortunately, we didn't spend a lot of time in Fukuoka. We had free reign so we walked around seeing the city and vendors. They have a fascinating different culture. Most people don't follow fashion trends, their accent is different, and less on societal stigmas. Not to mention, it was hot, phew.</p>
                  <p>Canal City Hakata, a sub city thats mostly a shopping district, is an amazing five story shopping mall that is practically its own city with everything from shops to hotels. When I was there, there was an event in the lobby of an anime convention with cosplayers and also game previews. A mix of comicon and E3.</p>

               <p>Sakura Blossum Festival! During our time in Japan, it was nearing the start of the blooming season, and you can see the signs in the trees that they were near blooming. It wasn't until we got back to Tokyo that the season had begun. Unfortunately, I lost a lot of photos about this trip as a tour through the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden shouldve been a Wonder of the World.</p>

               <p>If you like Japanese food, it will change your life to eat in Japan. The way they only have generally one type of food mixed with the Japanese values of competition and perfection makes their food leagues ahead of anything in America. It is absolutely amazing, and if you don't mind it ruining Japanese food when you return because it was so good. I highly recommend going just for the cuisine.</p>
